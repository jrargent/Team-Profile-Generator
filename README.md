# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This is a Team Profile Website generator that is meant to help the user quickly generate a webpage listing team members and their information. It uses node.js to prompt the user to answer questions in the terminal. The program then writes the user's inputs into a template and creates an HTML file.

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
